# hccodetech's OSS SW class practices

* Just yet another Github page for my practices of OSS SW class.

## What is OSS?

* Abbreviation of `Open Source Software`,<br>
  that software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.<br>
  *From: [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)*

* OSS does not always mean it's non-commercial.

* Still, most of them are `Free and Open Source Software` (FOSS)
