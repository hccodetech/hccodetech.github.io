# Week 1

## Setting up [Github](https://github.com) account

* In this week, we setup Github account.
  If we have email address, we can create Github account...
  Err... Yeah, it's that simple.

* Although many people setup account using their commonly use email addresses,
  and set to public it by default.
  I think we should be more cautious about it.
  As threat actors can abuse those email addresses for spamming, phishing, etc.
  Especially, when you are using same account name and <B>password</B> through various sites...

* You can enable "email privacy option" at https://github.com/settings/emails
  by setting below options.

- [x] Keep my email addresses private.
- [x] Block command line pushes that expose my email.

* By doing this, when you commit changes through Github's web ui,
  Github will uses dummy email address `@users.noreply.github.com`
  instead of your actual address.
  and hides your email address from your Github profile.

## Markdown

* And Markdown.

* There're plenty of webpages describing how to write docs using Markdown.
  for example,

1. https://www.markdownguide.org/

...etc.

* But we're using Github...
* Github slightly modifies Markdown to add more features.

1. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github

...etc.

* tl;dr (Cheat sheets)
