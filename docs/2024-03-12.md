# Week 1

## Setting up [Github](https://github.com) account

* In this week, we setup Github account.<br>
  If we have email address, we can create Github account...<br>
  Err... Yeah, it's that simple.

* Although many people setup account using their commonly use email addresses,<br>
  and set to public it by default.<br>
  I think we should be more cautious about it.<br>
  As threat actors can abuse those email addresses for spamming, phishing, etc.<br>
  Especially, when you are using same account name and <B>password</B> through various sites...

* You can enable "email privacy option" at [github.com/settings/emails](https://github.com/settings/emails)<br>
  by setting below options.

- [x] Keep my email addresses private.
- [x] Block command line pushes that expose my email.

* By doing this, when you commit changes through Github's web ui,<br>
  Github will uses dummy email address `@users.noreply.github.com`<br>
  instead of your actual address.<br>
  and hides your email address from your Github profile.

## [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

* And Markdown.

* There're plenty of resources describing how to write docs using Markdown.<br>
  for example,

1. [www.markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
2. ...etc.

* But we're using Github...
* Github slightly modifies Markdown to add more features.

1. [docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github)
2. ...etc.

* tl;dr (Cheat sheets)

1. [www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
2. [gist.github.com/stevenyap/7038119](https://gist.github.com/stevenyap/7038119)
3. ...etc.
4. ...ðŸš€

* While you can write & previewing Markdown docs easily on Github,<br>
  you can also writing those locally if you are using IDE or text editor with extension supports.

* I installed [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) and [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for convenience.

* Notes for me: Maybe trying [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/) is also fun ig. :P
