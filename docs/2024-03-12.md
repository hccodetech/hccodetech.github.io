# Week 1

## ProTip

1. Write/create plan before writing code.

## Setting up [Github](https://github.com) account

* In this week, we setup Github account.<br>
  If we have email address, we can create Github account...<br>
  Err... Yeah, it's that simple.

* Although many people setup account using their commonly use email addresses,<br>
  and set to public it by default.<br>
  I think we should be more cautious about it.<br>
  As threat actors can abuse those email addresses for spamming, phishing, etc.<br>
  Especially, when you are using same account name and <B>password</B> through various sites...

* You can enable "email privacy option" at [github.com/settings/emails](https://github.com/settings/emails)<br>
  by setting below options.

- [x] Keep my email addresses private.
- [x] Block command line pushes that expose my email.

* By doing this, when you commit changes through Github's web ui,<br>
  Github will uses dummy email address `@users.noreply.github.com`<br>
  instead of your actual address.<br>
  and hides your email address from your Github profile.

* You can also import Github repo to your [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) account.
* Or save code you write from Google Colab to Github.

## [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

* And Markdown.

* There're plenty of resources describing how to write docs using Markdown.<br>
  for example,

1. [www.markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
2. ...etc.

* But we're using Github...
* Github slightly modifies Markdown to add more features.

1. [docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github)
2. ...etc.

* tl;dr (Cheat sheets)

1. [www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
2. [gist.github.com/stevenyap/7038119](https://gist.github.com/stevenyap/7038119)
3. ...etc.
4. ...ðŸš€

* While you can write & previewing Markdown docs easily on Github,<br>
  you can also writing those locally if you are using IDE or text editor with extension supports.

* I installed [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) and [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for convenience.

* Notes for me: Maybe trying [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/) is also fun ig. :P

## [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* Visual Studio Code is a code editor<br>
  redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
* It's free and available on your favorite platform - Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* It follows open core model (Not actually open-source).
* You can manage/clone/commit to git repo... but...<br>
  Well, I recommends you just get used to CLI (Command Line Interface).

## [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

* Git is Version Control Software (VCS) or Revision Control Software (RCS)<br>
  commonly used for code snapshots these days.

1. [git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git)

* As we use Debian (Linux), to install git,

```sh
sudo apt install -y git
```

* To check whether git is correctly installed or not,

```sh
git --version
```

* We have semester assignment that doing contribution over 30 times over Github in this class.
* Something like... creating project, updating, creating issues, typo fixing, etc.

* First setup git email and user name globally.
* You can setup per repo if you run below commands in folders you are at wihout adding --global.

```sh
git config --global user.email "foo+bar@users.noreply.github.com"
git config --global user.name "foo bar"
```

* Set default editor you want
* Default editor is [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
* I will set to [GNU nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/)

```sh
git config --global core.editor nano
```

* Start from init git repo to add first commit.

```sh
# Creating folder or go to folder you want
mkdir foobar
cd foobar

# You can git init on folder that alreay have files or empty folder
git init

# If you already have files or added, by running this command,
# git will track all files under current directory recursively
# git doesn't track directories
# If you want to track it, well, just add dummy file or so
touch foo/.placeholder

git add .
git commit

# If you don't have files, that's okay.
# You can add empty commit by this command
git commit --allow-empty

# Write commit and message and save.
# In nano, to save it, press ctrl+s.

# Congratulations! You successfully init git and adding first commit!
```

## [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

* These shortcuts applied most of text editor and IDEs.
* ctrl+arrow key will move word by word.

* To make date input as form,

```python
#@title Date fields
date_input = '2024-03-01' #@param { type:"date" }

print(date_input)
```
